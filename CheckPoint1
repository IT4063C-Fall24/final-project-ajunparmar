Topic: My topic is investigating the demographic changes of the United States for the past 50-100 years to see how various demographics have changed in the U.S. Demographics such as race, gender, religion, income etc.
Project Questions: The questions that I want to ask are basically the why of every demographic whether a specific group is increasing or decreasing. I want to find out why specific demographics are decreasing or increasing and whether they are too immigration, new industries and various other factors that could be considered.
Answer: The answer could be given in many different types of graphs. Graphs like line graphs would work best with race or gender demographics and could be best displayed.

I can relate these datasets by the years that a specific demographic Iâ€™m trying to display and try to merge the datasets that way.
